## Hi 👋, I’m Safar Hashim

I’m a BTech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, focused on building practical projects and strengthening my fundamentals through hands-on development. I enjoy working on ideas that emphasize problem-solving, clean code, and real-world relevance.

My primary programming language is Python, which I use for data handling, problem-solving, and exploring machine learning concepts. I am building a strong foundation in AI and ML by applying theoretical concepts through small, incremental projects. I use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Currently, I’m focused on improving my problem-solving skills, deepening my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and working on projects that bridge theory with practical implementation.

I’m open to learning opportunities, collaborations, and contributing to meaningful projects.
